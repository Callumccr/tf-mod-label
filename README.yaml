   Use `tf-mod-label` to implement a strict, and consistent naming convention, tagging blocks, and outputs for infrastructure resources.

# How to use this module
usage: |-
  The below values shown in the usage of this module are purely representative, please replace desired values as required.

  ### Simple Usage:
    ```hcl
    module "label" {
      source             = "git::ssh://git@github.com:Callumccr/tf-mod-label.git?ref=master
      namespace          = "callum"
      environment        = "dev"
      name               = "label"
      attributes         = ["1"]
      delimiter          = "-"
      additional_tag_map = {} /* Additional attributes (e.g. 1) */
      label_order        = ["environment", "namespace", "name", "attributes"]
    }
    ```
    This will create an `id` with the value of `dev-callum-label-1` because when generating `id`, the default order is `environment`, `namespace`, `name`, `attributes`. (you can override it by using the `label_order` variable)
    
    Now reference the label when creating an instance:
    ```hcl
    resource "aws_instance" "default" {
      instance_type = "t1.micro"
      tags          = module.label.tags
    }
    ```

    Or define a security group:
    ```hcl
    resource "aws_security_group" "default" {
      vpc_id = var.vpc_id
      name   = module.label.id
      tags   = module.label.tags
      egress {
        from_port   = 0
        to_port     = 0
        protocol    = "-1"
        cidr_blocks = ["0.0.0.0/0"]
      }
    }
    ```
  
  ### Advanced Usage:

   - Full advanced examples can be found on the unmodified upstream provider [here](https://github.com/cloudposse/terraform-null-label/blob/master/README.yaml)

introduction: |-
    A label follows the following convention: `{environment}-{namespace}-{name}-{attributes}`. The delimiter (e.g. `-`) is interchangeable.
    The label items are all optional. So if you prefer the term `stage` to `environment` you can exclude environment and the label `id` will look like `{stage}-{namespace}-{name}-{attributes}`.
    If attributes are excluded but `stage` and `environment` are included, `id` will look like `{environment}-{stage}-{namespace}-{name}`
   
    It's recommended to use one `terraform-null-label` module for every unique resource of a given resource type.
    For example, if you have 10 instances, there should be 10 different labels.
    However, if you have multiple different kinds of resources (e.g. instances, security groups, file systems, and elastic ips), then they can all share the same label assuming they are logically related.
   
    **NOTE:** The `null` refers to the primary Terraform [provider](https://www.terraform.io/docs/providers/null/index.html) used in this module.
   
    Releases of this module from `0.12.0` onward support `HCL2` and only work with Terraform 0.12 or newer.
